# Example configuration file for defining VPN tunnels on the vShield Edge Gateway
#
# Note that applying this configuration file will replace the current VPN tunnels
# on the vShield Edge Gateway.
#
# Here be dragons:
# The vSE isn't the best at validating settings before trying to configure
# itself with them. Values for the following, that the vSE does not expect,
# could cause it to get into a bad state.
#
# mtu              - Maximum for your network.
# local_ip_address - IP address that belongs to the external network of the vSE
# local_subnets    - A local subnet which is directly attached to the vSE
